# Effective Smart Fan Deployment in NUS SDE Net-Zero Building
This repository features an react-native application to encourage energy saving behaviour in a newly built net-zero building installed with clusters of smart ceiling fans (Haiku). During the time this project was developed, there were only four fans available in a single test room. We created an mobile app to test out different energy saving strategies for the users. 

This project uses the following framework/tool:
- Node-RED
- OpenHAB
- React-Native
- Firebase

## Overview of the structure of the system
Please see Intro_system_structure.pdf in this repository. For the full report, you can find it at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362965996_Effective_smart_fan_deployment_in_NUS_SDE_Net-Zero_Building 

## Firebase real-time database
Please see firebase_realtime_database_structure.json in this repository

## React-native code
The rest of the code in the repository presents an react-native app (tested on iOS devices) that used for an user study with 21 participants. The details of the user study is documented in the Master's Thesis. As I graduated, this code is not actively maintained. It was written in 2018. You may need to do some adjustment according to the latest react-native version.
